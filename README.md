## Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development process. This repository demonstrates how to:
- Set up Jenkins on various environments.
- Configure jobs for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Secure and optimize Jenkins.

### About the Author
Hi, I'm Kovendhan! I am currently learning about Jenkins and exploring its real-time applications. As part of my journey, I created this repository to document my learning process and share practical examples and setups with others. I hope this helps anyone looking to get started with Jenkins.

## Features
- **Setup Instructions**: Detailed steps to install and configure Jenkins.
- **Pipeline Examples**: Ready-to-use Jenkins pipeline scripts (Declarative and Scripted).
- **Integration**: Examples of integrations with GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, and other tools.
- **Security Guidelines**: Steps to secure your Jenkins instance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before proceeding:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Jenkins War File or Installer**: [Download here](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
- **Supported Browser**: For accessing the Jenkins UI.
- **Admin Access**: Permissions to install software and configure Jenkins on your machine/server.

## Installation

1. **Install Java**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

2. **Download Jenkins**
   ```bash
   wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install jenkins
   ```

3. **Start Jenkins**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

4. **Access Jenkins**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:8080`.

## Usage

### Creating Your First Pipeline
1. Open Jenkins and navigate to `New Item`.
2. Select `Pipeline` and name your project.
3. Configure the pipeline using a Jenkinsfile or by writing inline pipeline code.
4. Save and run the pipeline.

### Sample Declarative Pipeline
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Configuration

- **Plugins**: Add plugins based on your requirements (e.g., GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes).
- **Security**: Set up an admin user, configure authentication and authorization, and enable CSRF protection.
- **Backup**: Use the `thinBackup` plugin or manually back up Jenkins configurations and job directories.
